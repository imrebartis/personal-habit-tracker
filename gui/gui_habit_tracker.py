"""
Personal Habit Tracker GUI - Entry point and error handling.

This module provides the main entry point for the GUI application
and handles fallback to CLI mode when GUI is unavailable.

Philosophy: All data stays local, uses only standard library (tkinter),
hackable and extensible, distraction-free design.
