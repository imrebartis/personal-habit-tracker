# Project Philosophy

## Overarching Vision

This habit tracker embodies the philosophy that meaningful change happens through small, consistent daily actions. It's designed to be a simple, distraction-free tool that focuses on what matters most: showing up every day.

## Who It's For

- **Beginners** starting their habit-building journey who need something simple and encouraging
- **Minimalists** who prefer command-line tools over bloated apps with notifications and social features
- **Developers** who want a lightweight, hackable solution they can customize and extend
- **Privacy-conscious individuals** who want their personal data to stay on their own machine
- **Anyone** who believes in the power of consistency over complexity

## Purpose

To provide the simplest possible interface between intention and action. No accounts, no subscriptions, no distractions - just you, your habits, and your progress.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

**The Complexity Problem**: Most habit tracking apps are overloaded with features, social elements, and monetization schemes that distract from the core purpose of building habits.

**The Privacy Problem**: Your personal growth data shouldn't be harvested, analyzed, or sold by tech companies.

**The Accessibility Problem**: Not everyone wants or can afford smartphone apps or web services. A simple Python script runs anywhere.

**The Motivation Problem**: Many people get discouraged when they break a streak. This tracker celebrates progress while being forgiving about setbacks, focusing on total completions alongside streaks.

**The Ownership Problem**: When you depend on external services, you lose control. This tool puts you in complete control of your data and experience.

The core belief is that habit formation is deeply personal and should remain private, simple, and under your complete control.
