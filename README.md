# Personal Habit Tracker

A minimalist command-line habit tracker that puts you in complete control of your personal growth journey. No accounts, no subscriptions, no data harvesting - just you, your habits, and your progress.

## Philosophy

This tool embodies the belief that meaningful change happens through small, consistent daily actions. It's designed for people who want a simple, distraction-free way to build habits without the complexity and privacy concerns of modern apps.

**Built for**: Beginners, minimalists, developers, and privacy-conscious individuals who believe in consistency over complexity.

## Why This Tracker?

- **Privacy First**: Your data stays on your machine - no cloud, no tracking
- **Distraction-Free**: No notifications, social features, or monetization schemes
- **Accessible**: Runs anywhere Python does - no smartphone required

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

#### Option 1: Simple Download
1. Clone or download this repository
2. No additional dependencies required - uses only Python standard library

#### Option 2: Proper Python Package (Optional)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd personal-habit-tracker

# Install as a package (optional)
pip install -e .

# Run from anywhere
personal-habit-tracker
```

### Usage

The Personal Habit Tracker offers both CLI and GUI interfaces:

#### Quick Start (Interactive Launcher)

**Cross-platform Python launcher:**
```bash
python habit_tracker.py
```

**Platform-specific launchers:**
```bash
# Windows
habit-tracker.bat

# Unix/Linux/macOS
./habit-tracker.sh
```

All launchers show an interactive menu to choose between CLI and GUI interfaces.

#### Direct Interface Launch
```bash
# CLI interface (default)
python personal_habit_tracker.py

# GUI interface
python personal_habit_tracker.py --gui

# Explicit CLI
python personal_habit_tracker.py --cli

# Alternative GUI launch
python -m gui.gui_habit_tracker
```

#### Interface Comparison

**CLI Interface** (Command Line):
- Text-based interaction
- Works on any system with Python
- Minimal resource usage
- Perfect for terminal users and automation
- **Habit management**: Only during initial setup (first run)

**GUI Interface** (Graphical):
- Visual interface with completion buttons and progress bars
- Mouse and keyboard interaction
- Real-time progress updates with visual streak indicators
- Celebration animations for achievements
- **Multiple completions per day** (same as CLI - click "Complete" multiple times)
- **Habit management**: Add/remove habits anytime via "Manage Habits" button
- Requires tkinter (included with most Python installations)

Both interfaces share the same data file (`habits_data.json`) and are fully compatible.

#### GUI Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+M**: Manage habits (add/remove)
- **Ctrl+H**: View progress history
- **F1**: Show help dialog
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between elements
- **Space/Enter**: Complete selected habit
- **Escape**: Close application

*Note: Progress is saved automatically after each completion - no manual save needed.*

#### Interface Behavioral Differences

While both interfaces share the same data and core functionality, there are some workflow differences:

**Habit Management:**
- **CLI**: Habits can only be added during initial setup (first run). To add new habits later, delete `habits_data.json` and restart.
- **GUI**: Habits can be added or removed anytime using the "Manage Habits" button (Ctrl+M).

**Session Management:**
- **CLI**: Session-based - runs once, processes all habits, then exits
- **GUI**: Persistent - stays open for continuous interaction

**Completion Workflow:**
- **CLI**: Linear - asks about each habit once per session (yes/no prompt)
- **GUI**: Interactive - click "Complete" button multiple times per habit

**Progress Viewing:**
- **CLI**: Shows progress summary at the end of each session
- **GUI**: Real-time progress display + separate "View History" dialog

**Data Persistence:**
- **CLI**: Saves once at the end of the session
- **GUI**: Auto-saves after each habit completion

**Celebrations:**
- **CLI**: Text-based celebration messages in console
- **GUI**: Animated popup windows for achievements

**Error Handling:**
- **CLI**: Text-based error messages, exits on critical errors
- **GUI**: Dialog boxes for errors, graceful fallback options

**Data Compatibility:**
- Both interfaces read and write the same `habits_data.json` format
- You can switch between CLI and GUI at any time without data loss
- All habit data (totals, streaks, dates) is preserved across interfaces

#### First Time Setup

When you run the app for the first time, you'll be prompted to create your habits:

```
No existing habits found. Let's create some!
Enter a habit to track (or type 'done' when finished): yoga
Enter a habit to track (or type 'done' when finished): running
Enter a habit to track (or type 'done' when finished): done
```

#### Daily Check-ins

Each time you run the app, you'll be asked about each habit:

```
Did you complete 'yoga' today? yes/no: yes
Great job! Keep up the streak! üî•
Did you complete 'running' today? yes/no: no
No worries! Tomorrow is another chance! üå§Ô∏è
```

#### Progress Summary

After each session, view your progress:

```
üìÖ Your Habit Progress:
Yoga: 5 times total, 3 day streak
üî• Great! 3 day streak for yoga!
Running: 2 times total, 0 day streak
```

## How Streaks Work

- **New Streak**: Starts at 1 when you complete a habit
- **Continuing Streak**: Increases by 1 if you completed the habit yesterday
- **Broken Streak**: Resets to 0 if you miss more than one day
- **Same Day**: Multiple completions on the same day don't increase the streak

## Streak Celebrations

- üî• **3+ days**: "Great! X day streak!"
- üèÜ **7+ days**: "Amazing! X week(s) streak!"

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_unit tests.test_integration tests.test_gui -v
```

Run only unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_unit -v
```

Run only integration tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_integration -v
```

Run only GUI tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_gui -v
```

Run tests with discovery (alternative):
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests -v
```

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests** (33 tests): Core function testing including habit creation, streak calculation, data persistence, celebration messages, and error handling
- **Integration Tests** (19 tests): End-to-end workflow testing including first-time setup, daily check-ins, multi-session persistence, and error recovery
- **GUI Tests** (21 tests): GUI component testing including initialization, event handling, backend integration, accessibility, and error handling

All tests use only Python standard library (unittest, mock) and maintain the project's philosophy of simplicity and privacy.

### Test Structure

The test suite uses a shared base class (`tests/test_base.py`) to eliminate code duplication:
- `BaseHabitTrackerTest`: Common setup/teardown for file-based tests
- Maintains DRY principles while keeping tests maintainable
- All test classes inherit from this base for consistent temporary file handling

### Git Hooks & Quality Assurance

The project includes simple Git hooks to maintain code quality without external dependencies:

#### Pre-push Hook
A Git pre-push hook automatically runs tests before allowing pushes:
- Located at `.git/hooks/pre-push`
- Prevents pushing if tests fail
- Uses only standard Git functionality and Python

#### Manual Test & Push
For manual control, use the provided batch script:
```bash
test-and-push
```

This script runs tests and only pushes if all tests pass, giving you explicit control over the process.

## Data Storage

Your habits are stored in `habits_data.json` with the following structure. This file is automatically created on first run and is gitignored to keep your personal data private:

```json
[
  {
    "habit": "yoga",
    "total_completed": 2,
    "current_streak": 2,
    "last_completed": "2025-09-24"
  }
]
```

## Philosophy-Driven Development

This project maintains strict alignment with its core philosophy through automated governance:

### Philosophy Enforcement
